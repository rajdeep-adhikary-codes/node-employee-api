# node-employee-api
api for employee table mysql

The aim of the project is to learn building api with node and mysql database.

So far in this project I have created 3 apis'

the first two are using the GET method. The first of them is to get all the records from the employee table and the second one is to get a perticular employee from the table.

In the third request however because I am trying to excute two queries in the same query() function it is giving me error. And two solve it next time I am thinking about changing the database structure.
Instead of using two table I am either gonna merge tables into one or, I will give the second table an 'employee_id' field which will help me join the tables later.

The database .sql file is already backed up in the repo and I am looking forward to work in the project later.
